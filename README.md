# Jugular-Venous-Pressure-Computer-Vision
Jugular venous pressure (JVP) is generally utilized as a quick and non-invasive evaluation method of a patient’s heart health, as swelling in this vein indicates changes in the body’s water regulation. An on-site system for measuring JVP, one that leverages computer vision to detect anomalies in the atrial contraction and venous filling waves, would allow for a cost efficient and flexible tool for monitoring heart health. 

We will develop the previous work on JVP with respect to two aspects of the computer vision algorithm. Throughout the fall we will collect datasets to explore a Machine Learning approach to this problem, and create a working prototype based on that approach or improving the existing Eulerian amplification method. Our algorithm’s performance goals are to recognize JVP with at least a 80% success rate with a processing time to below 5 minutes. By the end of the year, we plan for our system to be tested in a clinical trial.
